This is an organization containing source files for our project. 

This project introduces a novel way to manage your account through biometrics. 
Based on _Iden3_ technology and advanced _Deep Learning_ algorithms, we accomplished to create unique identities based on three types of biometrics: 
Face, Voice, and Passport Data, although the system is easily extended to more types of biometrical data. 
Additionally, we extend the protocol to include the functionality of transferring funds solely based on the person's photo 
as long as he is registered in the protocol.
